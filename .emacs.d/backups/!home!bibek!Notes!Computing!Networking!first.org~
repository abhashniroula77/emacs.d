<x-color><param>dodger blue</param>* Networking:</x-color>

  connection between computers/data centers.


  Protocol:

  Cable modem:

  Fiber optics cable:

  coaxial cable:

  DSL: Digital subscriber line

  ADSL: Asymetric DSL

  API: Application programming Interface

      Each application that has access to the internet needs to do a set of procedures before

  sending the packages in the internet.

<x-color><param>dodger blue</param>* Network core</x-color>

<x-color><param>#edd400</param>** Packets switching:</x-color>

   communication method in which transmitted data are broken down into

   suitable sized blocks called packets and are sent via a medium that

   may be shared by a multiple communication sessions.

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Store and forward switching:</x-color>

    The link, like router, doens't send a packet untill it is fully

    received. So, it stores in a buffer and sends it once it is fully

    received.

    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| so takes L/R time to recieve a packet and same to send it where</x-color>

    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>|   L is the length of the packet and R is the connected speed.</x-color>

    Time it takes is
<x-color><param>#edd400</param>** Circuit switching</x-color>

   In this mode of networking, some number of links that are available

   are used to create a dedicated, say reserved for the session,

   connection aka circuit which can provide guarrented constant speed

   unlike the packet switching methods.

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Multiplexing in CS network</x-color>

    Multiplexing: Basically the modes of providing services to different

    connections at the same time by a link.

    It occurs in two modes in CS network:

<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Frequency Division Multiplexing(FDM)</x-color>

     In this mode, the frequency spectrum used by a link is split into

     specific number of dedicated **frequency band** with specific width

     called **Bandwidth** Eg. telephone networks usually have 4kHz

     bandwidth. And these bands are used by different sender/reciever pair.

<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Time Division Multiplexing(TDM)</x-color>

     In this mode of multiplexing, the connection time is divided into

     specific intervals called **frames** which are further split into

     equal number of even smaller intervals called **slots**.


     Specific slots in every frame is dedicated for a particular sender/reciever

     pair.

<x-color><param>#edd400</param>** Network of Networks</x-color>

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Network structure 1</x-color>

    Access ISPs connected to the main top ISP who owns it all, aka Global Transit

    ISP. Global Transit ISP doens't have to pay anyone. It hosts everything and

    invest in the physical parts of the network.

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Network structure 2</x-color>

    Since the Global Transit ISP gains profit by providing services, there are

    competitions and many other GT ISPs rise into existence.

    Access ISPs and competiting GT ISPs and tier 1 ISP which are huge on themselves

    and host regional ISPs.

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Network structure 3</x-color>

    Multiple competiting regional ISPs in a region.

    In some region, regional ISPs may be as large as spanning a whole country.

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Network structure 4</x-color>

    It adds PoP, multi-homing, peering, Internet Exchange Points(IXP) to network

    structure 3.

<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Point of Presence(PoP)</x-color>

     This exists at all level of hierarchy except at the base.
<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Multi-homing</x-color>

     Costomer ISP at any level can connect to multiple provider ISP to get better

     and uninterrupted connection even when one is down. Called multi homing.

<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Peering</x-color>

     The ISPs at same level of heirarchy can peer meaning can agree to share

     data among themselves so that they can avoid costs to the upstream levels

     and benefit mutually.

<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Internet Exchange Points(IXP)</x-color>

     Similar to peering which is a standalone buildings with it's own switches.

     where multiple switches can peer together.

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Network Structure 5</x-color>

    It builds on the top of structure 4 by adding content provider Networks.

    Google is one of the leading content provider. It hosts data centers around

    the globe each of which can host thousands of servers. All of these are inter-

    connected with google's private TCP/IP Network.
