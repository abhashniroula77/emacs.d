  An application may be created by many different programmers. Like the client side of an application

  may be created by one developer and the server side of the applicatin by the other. In such case, the

  client and server side of the application have to be able to communicate with each other. For that to

  happen they need to meet conditions. This is done by both of the developers following/sticking to pre-set

  criterias like RFC.
