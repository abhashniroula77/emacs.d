* Networking:

  connection between computers/data centers.


  Protocol:

  Cable modem:

  Fiber optics cable:

  coaxial cable:

  DSL: Digital subscriber line

  ADSL: Asymetric DSL

  API: Application programming Interface

      Each application that has access to the internet needs to do a set of procedures before

  sending the packages in the internet.

* Network core

** Packets switching:

   communication method in which transmitted data are broken down into

   suitable sized blocks called packets and are sent via a medium that

   may be shared by a multiple communication sessions.

*** Store and forward switching:

    The link, like router, doens't send a packet untill it is fully

    received. So, it stores in a buffer and sends it once it is fully

    received.

    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| so takes L/R time to recieve a packet and same to send it where</x-color>

    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>|   L is the length of the packet and R is the connected speed.</x-color>

    Time it takes is
** Circuit switching

   In this mode of networking, some number of links that are available

   are used to create a dedicated, say reserved for the session,

   connection aka circuit which can provide guarrented constant speed

   unlike the packet switching methods.

*** Multiplexing in CS network

    Multiplexing: Basically the modes of providing services to different

    connections at the same time by a link.

    It occurs in two modes in CS network:

**** Frequency Division Multiplexing(FDM)

     In this mode, the frequency spectrum used by a link is split into

     specific number of dedicated **frequency band** with specific width

     called **Bandwidth** Eg. telephone networks usually have 4kHz

     bandwidth. And these bands are used by different sender/reciever pair.

**** Time Division Multiplexing(TDM)

     In this mode of multiplexing, the connection time is divided into

     specific intervals called **frames** which are further split into

     equal number of even smaller intervals called **slots**.


     Specific slots in every frame is dedicated for a particular sender/reciever

     pair.

** Network of Networks

*** Network structure 1

    Access ISPs connected to the main top ISP who owns it all, aka Global Transit

    ISP. Global Transit ISP doens't have to pay anyone. It hosts everything and

    invest in the physical parts of the network.

*** Network structure 2

    Since the Global Transit ISP gains profit by providing services, there are

    competitions and many other GT ISPs rise into existence.

    Access ISPs and competiting GT ISPs and tier 1 ISP which are huge on themselves

    and host regional ISPs.

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Network structure 3</x-color>

    Multiple competiting regional ISPs in a region.

    In some region, regional ISPs may be as large as spanning a whole country.

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Network structure 4</x-color>

    It adds PoP, multi-homing, peering, Internet Exchange Points(IXP) to network

    structure 3.

<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Point of Presence(PoP)</x-color>

     This exists at all level of hierarchy except at the base.
<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Multi-homing</x-color>

     Costomer ISP at any level can connect to multiple provider ISP to get better

     and uninterrupted connection even when one is down. Called multi homing.

<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Peering</x-color>

     The ISPs at same level of heirarchy can peer meaning can agree to share

     data among themselves so that they can avoid costs to the upstream levels

     and benefit mutually.

<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Internet Exchange Points(IXP)</x-color>

     Similar to peering which is a standalone buildings with it's own switches.

     where multiple switches can peer together.

*** Network Structure 5

    It builds on the top of structure 4 by adding content provider Networks.

    Google is one of the leading content provider. It hosts data centers around

    the globe each of which can host thousands of servers. All of these are inter-

    connected with google's private TCP/IP Network.

** Delay, Loss, Throughput in PSN

   Packet suffers several types of delay in each node along the path.

   Some of which are Nodal processing delay, queuing delay, transmission

   delay, and propagation delay.

   Together, they accumulate a Total nodal delay.

**** Nodal processing delay

     when the packet arrives at a node. It's header is read and the outbound

     link is processed and directed to the destination. This processing takes

     time callled Nodal processing delay.

**** Queuing delay

     When there is heavy traffic headed to the destination, the packet might

     have to wait before it begins to be transmitted.

**** Transmission delay

     Time it takes to transmit the data. Depends on the speed of the connection.

     L/R

**** Propagation delay

     The time it takes for the bits to arrive at the other node. the speed is

     nearly the speed of light and depends on the phycal medium.
*** Queing delay and Packet loss

    The router can not host infinite number of packets on the queue so when the

    traffic is crowded, some of the packets are lost.

    The packets that that arrive at the queue only to find that the place is

    full are dropped.

    The lost packets can be retransmitted to deliver the full data.
*** End-to-End delay

    delay till the data gets transmitted to the destination(the final one).

*** End system application and other delays

    End system or application may delay the packets transmission due to

    shared network as a part of it's transmission protocol for sharing.

    

*** Throughput in computer networks

    The instantaneous transmission rate. For some usage, delay doen't

    matter as much as the instantaneous throughput i.e. to have highest

    of throughput possible.


    Bottleneck link may be the throughput in the network.


** Layering of Protocol

   Internet protocol stack has five layers.
*** Application level protocols

    HTTP-for the web pages

    SMTP-for the email packages

    FTP-for transfer of files between two end systems.

    and also

    DNS-for traslation of network address into human readable address


    Employed among different application layer end system to exchange

    packages known as message.


*** Transport level

    It is to transport the application level pacakges to the application

    end points.

    Two types are :

    TCP: It provides guarantee of delivery of application layer messages

    to the destination and also flow control i.e. sender/receiver speed

    matching.

    

    UDP: It is connectionless  service to its applications. It makes no

    check of reliability, flow control and congestion control.


    A transprot level packet is called segment for this discussion.
*** Network level

    Network layer is responsible for moving Network layer packets aka

    datagrams from one host to another. Transport layer provides the

    trasnport level segment and a destination address. Network layer then

    provides the service of delivering those segments to the transport layer

    in destination host.


    IP protocol is widely known network protocol.

    also contains routing protocols which determines what route the packets

    take between server host and destination
*** Link level

    Protocol to transfer datagrams from one node/router in the route to

    another. Services provided depends on the specific protocol employed.


    Ex.

    Ethernet, WiFi, the cable access network's DOCSIS protocol etc.


    A packet form source can go though many different kinds of link level

    protocols each of which can provide different types of services.

    Link level packets are called frames.
*** Physical level

    This is the protocol concerning the howtos of transfering the actual

    bits from one node to another as opposed to the packets in the link level

    protocol.

    Obviously, it can be different depending upon the physical interface

    employed for the data transmission.
