* Analyzing insertion sort

  few terms and jargon:

<x-color><param>chocolate1</param>  # running time</x-color>

<x-color><param>chocolate1</param>  # input size</x-color>

<x-color><param>chocolate1</param>  # Worst and average case analysis</x-color>

**  Worst case

    The worst case or guarrented maximum time to perform the algorithm

    is denoted by \theta() function with meaningful function of n.


    Only the leading term of the function with highest exponent is of

    interest when dealing with worst case.


    An algorithm is considered more efficient if it's worst case running

    time has a lower order of growth.

  
* Designing algorithm


** Devide and conquer approach

   Includes three steps at each step of recursion


*** Divide

    the problem into a number of sumproblems that are smaller

    instances of the same problem.


*** conquer the sub-problmes by solving them recursively.


*** Combine

    the solutions to the subproblmes into the solution for original

    problem.


** Merge Sort
