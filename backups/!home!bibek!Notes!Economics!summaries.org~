<x-color><param>#edd400</param>** Law of Demand</x-color>

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>***    Behaviours of buyers</x-color>
individual demand studied in individual demand curve and market demand studied

in market demand curve. Market demand curve is the sum of all individual demands

for each position in the rate of the goods.
This curve shows what happens to the demand of the goods when the quantity of

price of the goods changes.


<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>***    Many factors can shift the demand curve for individual or market. And shift in</x-color>

curve means decrease or increase in the demand for same amount of price for the

goods. some factors are:
<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Income:</x-color>

     When income rises, one might want to incrase the comsumption.
<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Substitute:</x-color>

     price of substitute falls, demand of the product falls too.
<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** complements:</x-color>

    increase in demand of complement might increase the demand of

the product.
<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** future expectations:</x-color>
<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Incentives(psychological):</x-color>

    findings about the helpfulness of the goods.



When govenment tries to shift the demand curve for say tobacco products, they are

not rising the prices for the products, they are changing the above variables as

actual change in price would indicate the movement of consumer along the demand

curve due to price change.




<x-color><param>#edd400</param>** Law of Supply</x-color>

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Behaviours of sellers</x-color>

Law of supply


When the price goes down, producers gain little profit from the sell and might

decrease the supply.
Supply curve, individual supply curve for a producer/seller and market supply

curve which is the sum of the curve of all the sellers/producers.


Various factors might bring the shift in the supply curve, without actually

chaging the price of the goods.
Some of them are:

1. Fluctuation in the production cost:

   a. might be due to decrease in cost of inputs.
   b. due to advanced technology or machinazation>>less labour.


2. Future expectation:

if a producer expects the rise in the price of goods in the future, he might

increase the production of the goods.


3.No. of sellers:
Just as the decrease in the number of consumer decrease the demand in the

market, the decrease in the number of suppliers/seller decreases the supply of

goods.





<x-color><param>#edd400</param>** Equilibrium</x-color>



In the case of market equilibruim, as one might expect, the amount of goods that

consumers are able and willing to consume equals the amount of goods that the

suppliers are willing and able to supply(for a given price.)
This equilibrium price is also called clearing price.



Aka The Law of Supply and Demand: the price of any good adjusts to bring the

quantity supplied and quantity demanded for that good into a balance.



<x-color><param>#edd400</param>** Elasticity:</x-color>

	 It is how the indicator of how much the sellers and buyers respond

   to the changes in the market conditions like prices.


<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Price Elasticity of Demand:</x-color>

    By how much are the consumers willing to cut down the consumption

    given the change in price. The demand for a certain good is said to

    elasatic if it changes substantially on change in market condition.


    Again various factors may influence that amount some of which are:

    

***** Availability of close substitute:

      If there is a close substitute for a certain good, then the good

      tend to be more elasatic because the consumers have the alternative.


      Butter and margarine are substitute and increase in price of one with other's

      prince being constant, the Demand of Butter decreases significantly.


***** Necessities Vs. luxuries:

      Necessities tend to have inelastic demands, whereas luxuries tend to have

      elasatic demand.

      Charge by a doctor: Necessity and thus inelastic

      sailboats: luxury and thus elasatic (for general group of consumers.)

      It still might be a Necessity for avid sailors.


***** Definition of market(good):

      For. ex. food, a broad category tend to have inelastic demand.

      and Vanilla ice-cream, a pretty narrow market tends to have elastic demand.


***** Time Horizon:

      The time before the market reaches Equilibrium may be different for

      differnt types of goods.

<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Computing Price Elasticity of Demand:</x-color>

                                   Percentage change in quantity demanded

     Price Elasticity of Demand = ---------------------------------------

                                       	Percentage change in price


     Since the changes are opposite i.e. rise in price corresponds fall in demand

     price elasticity is negative. But the negative sign is ignored as convention.


     The problem is the elasticity equation gives different value on going from higher

     price to lower and the other way round because of different base of Percentage.

     To work around this, midpoint method is empoloyeed.

     

***** <x-color><param>tomato</param>That is the midpoint of the change is taken as the base of percentage.</x-color>


***** <x-color><param>tomato</param>Variety of Demand curve:</x-color>

      Because the elasticity of demand is closely related to the slope of the demand

      curve, it gives an idea of the elasticity. General ROT is that flatter the curve,

      more elastic the demand of the goods and inelastic otherwise.


      Vertical curve represents perfectly inelastic curve, there is no effect of price

      on the demand. And horizontal curve represents the perfectly elastic

      demand.


      Real life example of demand elasticity:

      Egg: .1

      Healthcare:.2

      Rice:.5

      Housing: .7

      Restaurant Meal: 2.3

      Mountain Dew: 4.4

      

**** <x-color><param>#6ac214</param>Total Revenue and Price Elasticity of Deamnd:</x-color>

     Total revenue is the amount of transaction/trade that occurs on buying/selling

     which is important.


     If demand curve is inelastic, the change in price directly(proportional)

     affects the total revenue.


     While if the demand curve is elastic, the change in price inversely affects

     the total revenue.


     When the demand is unit elastic(elasticity=1), the total revenue from the sell

     remains the same at all price point.


**** <x-color><param>#6ac214</param>Elasticity and Total Revenue along a Linear Demand curve.</x-color>

     Slope of linear curve is constant. But the elasticity is not. Why???

     Because the way elasticity and slope are defined.

     slope is defined unit-wise. While elasticity is defined percentage wise.

     And the base of percentage is variable depending on from which to which point

     the change in price occurs.


     \\\so, cut the curve with the line(A) x=y.


     \\\On change with midpoint on any point above the intersection of A with the curve,

     \\\have 


     At points with low price and high quantity, demand is inelastic. And at points with

     high price and low quantity demand is elastic.


     It shows constant elasticity is possible, but it's not always the case.

			 
**** <x-color><param>#6ac214</param>Other elasticity of Demands</x-color>

***** <x-color><param>tomato</param>Income elasticity of demand</x-color>

      Income elasticity of demand measures how change in income changes the demand of

      goods.


      demand of Normal goods are directly proportional to income level of consumer.

      But few "inferior goods" such as bus-rides are inverselly proportional to income

      of the consumer.


***** <x-color><param>tomato</param>Cross Price elasticity of Demand.</x-color>

      It measures how quantity demanded of one goods changes due to the change in price of

      another goods.


      Here Goods of our concern are of two types. Substitute and complement.

      Substitute price increases, goods demnad increases. and otherwise.


      while compliments price decreases, demand of good increases and likewise.


<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Elasticity of Supply</x-color>

    The measure of how the supply of a certain goods changes due to change

    in various market conditions like price.

    The response of supply to the changed conditions tend to show up spanning

    a time period. Since the production of the goods takes time to moderate.


<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Price elasticity of supply</x-color>

    Formula for the elasticity is similar. It's the ratio of percentage change

    in the quantity of supply to the percentage change in the price.


<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Variety of supply curves</x-color>

     The elasticity of supply is also not constant at differnt price point.

     All the similar cases apply to supply curve as do to the demand curve.


     Some markets are perfectly inelastic: for ex. supply of land is the same

     nomatter the price point.


     
<x-color><param>#edd400</param>** Applications of Supply demand and Elasticity</x-color>

   these basic laws can be applied carefully to examine and predict the

   short term and long term effect in price and economy of a certain market.


<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** Ex. of hybrid seed</x-color>

     When a hybrid seed of wheat is engineered. the farmers are able to produce

   more wheat. That increases the supply of goods. That is to say supply curve

   shifts to right. But the demand of the wheat stays the same. So, what happens

   next is obvious, the balance between supply and demand curve decreases the

   price of wheat. This decrease of price is for sure. BUt does it increase or

   decrease the total revenue each farmer make depends on the elasticity of the

   supply curve.


   So, in cases, farmers may be worse off due to the introduction of the new hybrid

   variety of wheat seed. But the only option for farmers is to adapt to the change.

   Since, single farmer really has nothing that he can do about it. And it is the

   nature of "competitive market economy" intrinsically.


**** <x-color><param>#6ac214</param>Oil supply countries</x-color>

     Petroleum exporting countries of the world have an association called Organization

     of Petroleum Exporting Countries(OPEC).

     In '1970s the OPEC countries decided to increase their revenue from the export of

     oil by raising the price. They achieved this by jointly reducing the amount of

     oil each of the nations supply to the world.

     Just within a year from 1973 to '74 the price of the oil rose by more than 50

     percent.

     Few years later, they did the same thing again.The price of oil approximately

     doubled during 1979 to 1981.


     For some reason, to be known later, the OPEC found it difficult to maintain a

     high price of the oil. From 1982 to 1985, the price of oil declined steadily

     10% a year.

     In 1986, the price decreased by 45% and by 1990, the price of oil(adjusted for

     the inflation), droped down to what it was back in 1970.


     My explanation to this:

     Desire to increase revenue led to limit the supply of oil by OPEC. This plan

     worked because the market of petroleum is not so elastic, which meant the increase

     in price and total revenue. The world began to ajdust to the limited supply of the

     petroleum (to be continued.)

<x-color><param>#edd400</param>** Supply Demand and Government Policies:</x-color>

   

   Government has the power to set the maximum and the minimum possible price

   for a market, the floor price and the ceiling price.

   Ceiling price comes in two categories. It can be above the equilibrium price

   or below it.

   When ceiling price is above the equilibruim price, it doesn't have any effect

   on the market price, but when the ceiling price is binding i.e. it's below the

   equilibruim price, the market price by law can not rise above the ceiling impo-

   sed.This lowering of price creates a decrease in the supply.

   Consumers have to compete for the good although for a lower price.


   

<x-color><param>#edd400</param>** How price ceiling effects market outcomes</x-color>

   When the government imposes a binding price ceiling on a competitive market,

   a shortage of the good arises, and sellers must ration the scarce goods among

   the large number of potential buyers.

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Shortage of Gas and ceiling price.</x-color>
    
<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Rent control in short and long run</x-color>

    price ceiled. owner get low rents anyway. They respond to the decrease in the

    price in long run. Quantity of housing available for rent decreases. shortage

    of rooms creates competittion among the tennants. That means owners are not

    going to make sure of the quality of the housing and services to the tennants.


    Thus rent control might seem good in the short term. But in the long run

    it creates shortage of housing and lowering of the quality of the available

    housing.


  
<x-color><param>#edd400</param>** Effects of price floor on marktet outcomes</x-color>

   There are two cases of price floor. One that is above the equilibruim price and

   one that is below it.

   If the floor price is lower, it doesn't have any particular effect on market

   outcomes. The market can find a natural equilibruim.

   But when the floor is above the equilibruim price, the market price can lower

   no further than the floor price. That means the price is raised. And from the

   demand curve, the demand of the goods decreases depending upon the elasticity

   of the market.

   On the other hand, the supply of the goods increases now that the price has

   raised(again from the curve for supply).

   This creates a surplus of the goods on the market. Which has all sorts of -ve

   effects.


*** <x-color><param>#edd400</param>The minimum wage</x-color>

    Raising the minimum wage decreases the demand for the labour. And though it might

    increase the income level of some employees, it renders other people jobless.


    


    So, instead of enforcing a binding floor price or similar ceiling price,

    government often rely on subsidies. They help raise the needy from problem and

    at the same time not hurt them in indirect way.


    

<x-color><param>#edd400</param>** Taxes</x-color>

   Taxation is the source of revenue for the government or local authority for

   carrying out works.

   It can be levied on various things.

   Most common one is on the sale of goods.

   But who actually pays the tax? Buyer? or the seller?


   Or if they share the tax, who decides how much is shared by who?

   Tax incidence is the manner in which the burden of tax is shared among the

   participant in the market.

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Tax on sellers and market outcomes</x-color>

    What happens when tax is imposed on the sellers?

    The production value for the suppliers increases and the supply curve shifts

    upward since the sellers are willing to sell less for any price point than

    before. And the demand curve stays the same because it doesn't affect the

    demand directly. So, the equibrium price increases but the goods supplied

    decreases. That means the tax is shared by both the sellers and the buyers.

    
    Tax on sellers > increase in production cost > shift of supply curve upward/left

    > quantity supply decreased and price point increased (depending on the elasticity

    of supply curve and the demand curve).

    Hence, burden of tax shared among sellers and buyers, proportion decided by the

    curve elasticities.

    

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Tax on buyers and outcomes</x-color>

    Tax on buyers > increase in price > demand curve shifts to left/downward. > quantity

    consumed decreased & price decreased. > both buyer and seller worse off.


<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Implication of above:</x-color>

    The burden of tax is shared is solely determined by the elasticity of the market

    regardless of whether the tax is imposed on the sell or purchase.


<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Tax incidence and Elasticity</x-color>

    As already mentioned, the incidence of the tax is determined by the relative elasticities

    of the demand and supply curve. If the demand curve is more elastic, the tax burden is

    more on the sellers. Similarly, if the supply curve is more elastic, the tax burden is

    more on the buyers end.

    which is intuitive and makes sense.


    
<x-color><param>dodger blue</param>* Welfare Economics</x-color>

<x-color><param>#edd400</param>** Consumers, producers and efficiency of the markets</x-color>

<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Consumer surplus</x-color>

    with a slight analysis, it is obvious that the area below the demand

    curve and above the price is the amount of total consumer surplus

    for the market.


<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Produer Surplus</x-color>

    The amount above the least amount that producer would agree to sell

    the goods in which the sell actually occurs is known as producer

    surplus.


    It is the area above the supply curve and below the price point.


<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Deadweight loss:</x-color>

    the loss in the total of consumer and producer surplus which doesn't

    account for the government revenue is known as deadweight loss.


    Taxation results in deadweight loss. Because it provides an incentives

    for the buyer not to buy the goods and sellers not to produce the goods.

    For the marginal buyers i.e. those consumers and suppliers who are on the

    edge of the surplus being zero, the taxation creates no reason to trade.

    They end up not trading at all. This is basically what reduces the quantity

    demanded and supplied once the taxation is enforced by the government.


<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** A tax on the market decreases the overall surplus of both supplier and consumer</x-color>
<x-color><param>tomato</param>**** That is total well-being decreases.</x-color>


<x-color><param>#6ac214</param>*** Supply side economics and Laffer curve.</x-color>

    keeping the supply and demand curve fixed, on increasing the tax on the market,

    the deadweight loss increases continually but the government revenue first

    increases and then decreases.


    So, two model of government may be collecting same amount of tax revenue but

    enforcing high and low tax on the market and therefore supporting lower and

    higher economic well-being of people.
