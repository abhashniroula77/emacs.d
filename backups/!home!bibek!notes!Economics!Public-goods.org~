* Goods devided into four types:

  <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>|whether it is excludable</x-color>


** Free rider :one who receives the benefits of resources but avoids paying for it.


** Things of national defense

   National defence from foreign aggresors is classic example of public good.

   Once the country is defended, it is impossible to prevent any one person from

   enjoying the benefit of this defense.


** Basic research

   Firms value the development of new products over the development of basic

   knowledge that would later lead to new technologies as they like to free ride

   on any knowledge that comes out on itself.

   Governmental insitutions try to subsidize these basic researches so as to

   keep those new knowledge coming.



   
* Cost benefit analysis

  There arises a unique problem when trying to analyse the cost and benefit

  a public good. Asking people for their cost and benefit for a certain goods

  is not reliable since they have little incentive to tell the truth. The data

  surveyed are exagerated for that reason.


  So, cost benefit analysis of a public good is very difficult compared to a

  private goods.
