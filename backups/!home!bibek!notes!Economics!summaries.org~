* How markets Work: Supply and Demand


** Law of Demand

***    Behaviours of buyers
individual demand studied in individual demand curve and market demand studied

in market demand curve. Market demand curve is the sum of all individual demands

for each position in the rate of the goods.
This curve shows what happens to the demand of the goods when the quantity of

price of the goods changes.


***    Many factors can shift the demand curve for individual or market. And shift in

curve means decrease or increase in the demand for same amount of price for the

goods. some factors are:
**** Income:

     When income rises, one might want to incrase the comsumption.
**** Substitute:

     price of substitute falls, demand of the product falls too.
**** complements:

    increase in demand of complement might increase the demand of

the product.
**** future expectations:
**** Incentives(psychological):

    findings about the helpfulness of the goods.



When govenment tries to shift the demand curve for say tobacco products, they are

not rising the prices for the products, they are changing the above variables as

actual change in price would indicate the movement of consumer along the demand

curve due to price change.




** Law of Supply

*** Behaviours of sellers

Law of supply


When the price goes down, producers gain little profit from the sell and might

decrease the supply.
Supply curve, individual supply curve for a producer/seller and market supply

curve which is the sum of the curve of all the sellers/producers.


Various factors might bring the shift in the supply curve, without actually

chaging the price of the goods.
Some of them are:

1. Fluctuation in the production cost:

   a. might be due to decrease in cost of inputs.
   b. due to advanced technology or machinazation>>less labour.


2. Future expectation:

if a producer expects the rise in the price of goods in the future, he might

increase the production of the goods.


3.No. of sellers:
Just as the decrease in the number of consumer decrease the demand in the

market, the decrease in the number of suppliers/seller decreases the supply of

goods.





** Equilibrium



In the case of market equilibruim, as one might expect, the amount of goods that

consumers are able and willing to consume equals the amount of goods that the

suppliers are willing and able to supply(for a given price.)
This equilibrium price is also called clearing price.



Aka The Law of Supply and Demand: the price of any good adjusts to bring the

quantity supplied and quantity demanded for that good into a balance.



** Elasticity:

	 It is how the indicator of how much the sellers and buyers respond

   to the changes in the market conditions like prices.


*** Price Elasticity of Demand:

    By how much are the consumers willing to cut down the consumption

    given the change in price. The demand for a certain good is said to

    elasatic if it changes substantially on change in market condition.


    Again various factors may influence that amount some of which are:

    

***** Availability of close substitute:

      If there is a close substitute for a certain good, then the good

      tend to be more elasatic because the consumers have the alternative.


      Butter and margarine are substitute and increase in price of one with other's

      prince being constant, the Demand of Butter decreases significantly.


***** Necessities Vs. luxuries:

      Necessities tend to have inelastic demands, whereas luxuries tend to have

      elasatic demand.

      Charge by a doctor: Necessity and thus inelastic

      sailboats: luxury and thus elasatic (for general group of consumers.)

      It still might be a Necessity for avid sailors.


***** Definition of market(good):

      For. ex. food, a broad category tend to have inelastic demand.

      and Vanilla ice-cream, a pretty narrow market tends to have elastic demand.


***** Time Horizon:

      The time before the market reaches Equilibrium may be different for

      differnt types of goods.

**** Computing Price Elasticity of Demand:

                                   Percentage change in quantity demanded

     Price Elasticity of Demand = ---------------------------------------

                                       	Percentage change in price


     Since the changes are opposite i.e. rise in price corresponds fall in demand

     price elasticity is negative. But the negative sign is ignored as convention.


     The problem is the elasticity equation gives different value on going from higher

     price to lower and the other way round because of different base of Percentage.

     To work around this, midpoint method is empoloyeed.

     

***** That is the midpoint of the change is taken as the base of percentage.


***** Variety of Demand curve:

      Because the elasticity of demand is closely related to the slope of the demand

      curve, it gives an idea of the elasticity. General ROT is that flatter the curve,

      more elastic the demand of the goods and inelastic otherwise.


      Vertical curve represents perfectly inelastic curve, there is no effect of price

      on the demand. And horizontal curve represents the perfectly elastic

      demand.


      Real life example of demand elasticity:

      Egg: .1

      Healthcare:.2

      Rice:.5

      Housing: .7

      Restaurant Meal: 2.3

      Mountain Dew: 4.4

      

**** Total Revenue and Price Elasticity of Deamnd:

     Total revenue is the amount of transaction/trade that occurs on buying/selling

     which is important.


     If demand curve is inelastic, the change in price directly(proportional)

     affects the total revenue.


     While if the demand curve is elastic, the change in price inversely affects

     the total revenue.


     When the demand is unit elastic(elasticity=1), the total revenue from the sell

     remains the same at all price point.


**** Elasticity and Total Revenue along a Linear Demand curve.

     Slope of linear curve is constant. But the elasticity is not. Why???

     Because the way elasticity and slope are defined.

     slope is defined unit-wise. While elasticity is defined percentage wise.

     And the base of percentage is variable depending on from which to which point

     the change in price occurs.


     \\\so, cut the curve with the line(A) x=y.


     \\\On change with midpoint on any point above the intersection of A with the curve,

     \\\have 


     At points with low price and high quantity, demand is inelastic. And at points with

     high price and low quantity demand is elastic.


     It shows constant elasticity is possible, but it's not always the case.

			 
**** Other elasticity of Demands

***** Income elasticity of demand

      Income elasticity of demand measures how change in income changes the demand of

      goods.


      demand of Normal goods are directly proportional to income level of consumer.

      But few "inferior goods" such as bus-rides are inverselly proportional to income

      of the consumer.


***** Cross Price elasticity of Demand.

      It measures how quantity demanded of one goods changes due to the change in price of

      another goods.


      Here Goods of our concern are of two types. Substitute and complement.

      Substitute price increases, goods demnad increases. and otherwise.


      while compliments price decreases, demand of good increases and likewise.


*** Elasticity of Supply

    The measure of how the supply of a certain goods changes due to change

    in various market conditions like price.

    The response of supply to the changed conditions tend to show up spanning

    a time period. Since the production of the goods takes time to moderate.


**** Price elasticity of supply

    Formula for the elasticity is similar. It's the ratio of percentage change

    in the quantity of supply to the percentage change in the price.


**** Variety of supply curves

     The elasticity of supply is also not constant at differnt price point.

     All the similar cases apply to supply curve as do to the demand curve.


     Some markets are perfectly inelastic: for ex. supply of land is the same

     nomatter the price point.


     
** Applications of Supply demand and Elasticity

   these basic laws can be applied carefully to examine and predict the

   short term and long term effect in price and economy of a certain market.


**** Ex. of hybrid seed

     When a hybrid seed of wheat is engineered. the farmers are able to produce

   more wheat. That increases the supply of goods. That is to say supply curve

   shifts to right. But the demand of the wheat stays the same. So, what happens

   next is obvious, the balance between supply and demand curve decreases the

   price of wheat. This decrease of price is for sure. BUt does it increase or

   decrease the total revenue each farmer make depends on the elasticity of the

   supply curve.


   So, in cases, farmers may be worse off due to the introduction of the new hybrid

   variety of wheat seed. But the only option for farmers is to adapt to the change.

   Since, single farmer really has nothing that he can do about it. And it is the

   nature of "competitive market economy" intrinsically.


**** Oil supply countries

     Petroleum exporting countries of the world have an association called Organization

     of Petroleum Exporting Countries(OPEC).

     In '1970s the OPEC countries decided to increase their revenue from the export of

     oil by raising the price. They achieved this by jointly reducing the amount of

     oil each of the nations supply to the world.

     Just within a year from 1973 to '74 the price of the oil rose by more than 50

     percent.

     Few years later, they did the same thing again.The price of oil approximately

     doubled during 1979 to 1981.


     For some reason, to be known later, the OPEC found it difficult to maintain a

     high price of the oil. From 1982 to 1985, the price of oil declined steadily

     10% a year.

     In 1986, the price decreased by 45% and by 1990, the price of oil(adjusted for

     the inflation), droped down to what it was back in 1970.


     My explanation to this:

     Desire to increase revenue led to limit the supply of oil by OPEC. This plan

     worked because the market of petroleum is not so elastic, which meant the increase

     in price and total revenue. The world began to ajdust to the limited supply of the

     petroleum (to be continued.)


**** Drug Intervention, Drug use and Drug related crimes





** Supply Demand and Government Policies:

   

   Government has the power to set the maximum and the minimum possible price

   for a market, the floor price and the ceiling price.

   Ceiling price comes in two categories. It can be above the equilibrium price

   or below it.

   When ceiling price is above the equilibruim price, it doesn't have any effect

   on the market price, but when the ceiling price is binding i.e. it's below the

   equilibruim price, the market price by law can not rise above the ceiling impo-

   sed.This lowering of price creates a decrease in the supply.

   Consumers have to compete for the good although for a lower price.


   

** How price ceiling effects market outcomes

   When the government imposes a binding price ceiling on a competitive market,

   a shortage of the good arises, and sellers must ration the scarce goods among

   the large number of potential buyers.

*** Shortage of Gas and ceiling price.
    
*** Rent control in short and long run

    price ceiled. owner get low rents anyway. They respond to the decrease in the

    price in long run. Quantity of housing available for rent decreases. shortage

    of rooms creates competittion among the tennants. That means owners are not

    going to make sure of the quality of the housing and services to the tennants.


    Thus rent control might seem good in the short term. But in the long run

    it creates shortage of housing and lowering of the quality of the available

    housing.


  
** Effects of price floor on marktet outcomes

   There are two cases of price floor. One that is above the equilibruim price and

   one that is below it.

   If the floor price is lower, it doesn't have any particular effect on market

   outcomes. The market can find a natural equilibruim.

   But when the floor is above the equilibruim price, the market price can lower

   no further than the floor price. That means the price is raised. And from the

   demand curve, the demand of the goods decreases depending upon the elasticity

   of the market.

   On the other hand, the supply of the goods increases now that the price has

   raised(again from the curve for supply).

   This creates a surplus of the goods on the market. Which has all sorts of -ve

   effects.


*** The minimum wage

    Raising the minimum wage decreases the demand for the labour. And though it might

    increase the income level of some employees, it renders other people jobless.


    


    So, instead of enforcing a binding floor price or similar ceiling price,

    government often rely on subsidies. They help raise the needy from problem and

    at the same time not hurt them in indirect way.


    

** Taxes

   Taxation is the source of revenue for the government or local authority for

   carrying out works.

   It can be levied on various things.

   Most common one is on the sale of goods.

   But who actually pays the tax? Buyer? or the seller?


   Or if they share the tax, who decides how much is shared by who?

   Tax incidence is the manner in which the burden of tax is shared among the

   participant in the market.

*** Tax on sellers and market outcomes

    What happens when tax is imposed on the sellers?

    The production value for the suppliers increases and the supply curve shifts

    upward since the sellers are willing to sell less for any price point than

    before. And the demand curve stays the same because it doesn't affect the

    demand directly. So, the equibrium price increases but the goods supplied

    decreases. That means the tax is shared by both the sellers and the buyers.

    
    Tax on sellers > increase in production cost > shift of supply curve upward/left

    > quantity supply decreased and price point increased (depending on the elasticity

    of supply curve and the demand curve).

    Hence, burden of tax shared among sellers and buyers, proportion decided by the

    curve elasticities.

    

*** Tax on buyers and outcomes

    Tax on buyers > increase in price > demand curve shifts to left/downward. > quantity

    consumed decreased & price decreased. > both buyer and seller worse off.


*** Implication of above:

    The burden of tax is shared is solely determined by the elasticity of the market

    regardless of whether the tax is imposed on the sell or purchase.


*** Tax incidence and Elasticity

    As already mentioned, the incidence of the tax is determined by the relative elasticities

    of the demand and supply curve. If the demand curve is more elastic, the tax burden is

    more on the sellers. Similarly, if the supply curve is more elastic, the tax burden is

    more on the buyers end.

    which is intuitive and makes sense.


    
* Welfare Economics

** Consumers, producers and efficiency of the markets

*** Consumer surplus

    with a slight analysis, it is obvious that the area below the demand

    curve and above the price is the amount of total consumer surplus

    for the market.


*** Produer Surplus

    The amount above the least amount that producer would agree to sell

    the goods in which the sell actually occurs is known as producer

    surplus.


    It is the area above the supply curve and below the price point.


*** Deadweight loss:

    the loss in the total of consumer and producer surplus which doesn't

    account for the government revenue is known as deadweight loss.


    Taxation results in deadweight loss. Because it provides an incentives

    for the buyer not to buy the goods and sellers not to produce the goods.

    For the marginal buyers i.e. those consumers and suppliers who are on the

    edge of the surplus being zero, the taxation creates no reason to trade.

    They end up not trading at all. This is basically what reduces the quantity

    demanded and supplied once the taxation is enforced by the government.


**** A tax on the market decreases the overall surplus of both supplier and consumer
**** That is total well-being decreases.


*** Supply side economics and Laffer curve.

    keeping the supply and demand curve fixed, on increasing the tax on the market,

    the deadweight loss increases continually but the government revenue first

    increases and then decreases.


    So, two model of government may be collecting same amount of tax revenue but

    enforcing high and low tax on the market and therefore supporting lower and

    higher economic well-being of people.

    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| corresponds to the lower tax rate and higher economic well-being is known</x-color>

    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| as supply side economics.</x-color>


    The curve first noted by Arthur Laffer in 1974.


** International Trade

   The country with a lower marginal cost for a certain market is

   likely to be the supplier to the world. And the one with the

   higher is likely to be the buyer.


   Small economy assumption: Small economy is the economy which is

   small in size meaning the amount of importing and exporting it

   does is not likely to change the price in the world market.


*** Gains and losses in an Exporting country

    Only those country are able to export which are producing the

    goods in the price less than the world market price.


    So, when the country is open to international trade, the price of

    market rises until it is equal to the world market price.

    No supplier is ready to sell the goods in anything less of a price.

    And no buyer would pay more than world price.

    The supply of the goods rises and so does the price.

    Hence, Domestic consumption of the goods decreases due to

    change in price point.

    And the sellers are able to export the goods.


    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| Local Consumer are worse off. Surplus decreases |</x-color>

    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| Local supplier are better off, they get to export</x-color>

    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| And also the total surplus is now bigger due to increase</x-color>

    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>|  in price and quantity demanded.</x-color>


*** Gains and losses of an Importing Country

    A country doesn't import a good unless it is available for

    less price in the world than it costs to produce the same

    goods in the country.


    Once the country is open to trade, first the price of the

    market goes down. No one is willing to buy in any price above

    the world price. The quantity supply of the goods falls because

    of shift in price point.

    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| Consumer are better off. They get the goods in less amount.</x-color>

    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| Suppliers are worse off. They get less price and also less of</x-color>

    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>|  their products are marketed.</x-color>

    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| Country as a whole is better off. The gain of the consumer</x-color>

    <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>|   outnumber the losses of the supplier.</x-color>


** Effects of a Tariff

   Fig. 4

   Tariff works when the country is importing goods and if otherwise.

   Tariff is imposed, the price of the goods to the buyer from world

   market increases which in turn increases domestic price as well. Since,

   domestic producers also aren't gonna settle for anything less.


   the quantity demanded of good decreases. This creates 4 things:

<x-color><param>chocolate1</param>   # The supplier are better off compared to when without tarrif</x-color>

<x-color><param>chocolate1</param>   # but still below when the trade was off.</x-color>


<x-color><param>chocolate1</param>   # The consumers are worse off , a little closer to the domestic</x-color>

<x-color><param>chocolate1</param>   # equilibrium than when no tariff.</x-color>


<x-color><param>chocolate1</param>   # Government gets to collect revenue on import.</x-color>


<x-color><param>chocolate1</param>   # There is a deadweight loss too.</x-color>


   <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| Also another way to limit trade is to impose quota on trade.</x-color>


** Other benefits of international trade.
*** Increased variety of goods

    es obioso. :)

*** Lower price through the economies of scale

    Some goods can be produced in lower cost if produced in high quantity.

    A firm in a small country can not take full advantage of this economies

    of scale. But trade allows it to be able to produce and sell more

    products.
*** Increased competition

    No competition >> monopoly(sortof) >> increased price => market failure

*** enhanced flow of ideas

    obvioso.

    

** Arguments for trade restriction

*** job opportunities in the local market/ country.

   Though not true. the might also argue that everything is produced cheap

   abroad and that would mean people will be jobless at home with trade.

   That is not true, however. Both trading country can still benefit from

   the trade even if one country is better at producing everything than the

   other.

*** National security arguement

    Concerning national defence. like when a war brokes out, the country that

    imports large portion of it's weaponry from another country might have a

    severe disadvantage if the exporting nation increased the price dramatically

    or discontinued the export of the arms altogether.

*** Infant industry Argument

    Opponent of trade argue that the industry at home are at infant stage and

    they would be mature in near future if government would provide protection

    to them temporarily.

    However, they are problematic, the "temporary" protection tends to be pushed.

    Also politics comes into the scene and only politically powerfull industies

    are protected.


    Also government should evaluate the future benefits of mature company and

    the cost of their protection as disadvantage to the consumers.

*** Unfair competition argument

    It is unfair, the proponent of trade limitation argue, that the similar

    industries in different countries are treated differently in different con-

    tries but they have to compete against each other.

    some government might subsidize some industry while others might not.

    
** <x-color><param>Pink</param>TODO</x-color> unilateral and bilateral trade policy:

   Two types of policy a country might adopt regarding the international

   trade.


* The Economics of the Public Sector

** Externalities

   The other considerations besides the force that drive the choice

   of buyer and the supplier in the market.

   For example, the emmision of harmful gas dioxin to the environment

   but that is not significant in the buyer's decision to consume papers

   and sellers decision to sell it. But, it effects the overall wellfare

   of the market public nonetheless.


   So, government comes into play. 

** Negative Externalities

   Negetive externalities are the influences that a market has on a society

   not directly expressed in monetary terms. They are the indirect cost

   to the society due to the market.

   For eg. Market for plastics.

   Plstic market has many negetive impacts to the society which may include

   health cost to the public.

   Ideally this cost should come into the equilibrium picture of demand and

   supply. But it does not. And that might sometime mean that the overall

   surplus or benefit of market is overshadowed by the indirect cost to the

   society that is being overlooked in the economy.


   That is resolved by the verious incentives to decrease the demand by

   policy-makers.

   

** Positive Externalities

   Positive Externatlities are the indirect benefits to the society due to

   a market that does not enter the picture of economy.


   It might be the health benefit from the plantation of trees for economic

   purposes(paper production, lumber, textiles, ..).


   Similarly, Take education. The behind the scene benefits of education includes:

   <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| Lower crime rate</x-color>

   <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| Informed voters and possibly good governmence</x-color>

   <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| Incentives to technological development and</x-color>

   <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| higher productivity and wages</x-color>


   This benefits means the market has unseen possible benefits and in ideal governance,

   the market is incentivized.


   To internalize this externality, government comes in as in the case of negative

   externalities only this time with subsidy instead of taxation.




   To summarize: Negative externalities lead markets to produce more goods than is socially

   desirable. Positive externalities lead markets to produce less goods than is socially

   desirable.To remedy these situations, govenment comes in and tries and internalizes the

   externalities with taxes and subsidies.


*  Policies towards externalities


** Regulation: command and control

*** Corrective Taxes and Subsidies

    The negative externalities imposed by a market can be brought into the eco-

    nomy by introducing the taxes. This way a real cost is added to the market which

    discourages the market to the extent of externalities.

    For. eg. High taxation on gasoline, a market whose externalities are:

    congestion and pollution


** Internalizing externalities

   involves moral code and ethics. People don't litter just because it is not

   the moral or right thing to do.


   externalities of one market can benefit economy of other market. If one is

   to adapt both the markets the externality now no longer remains an externality.

   It adds to the profit.

   This is one of the reasons why firms are involved in different types of

   businesses.


* Case study: Coase theorem

  <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| If private parties can bargain without cost over the allocation of resources,</x-color>

  <x-color><param>LightSkyBlue</param>| they can solve the problem of externalities on their own.</x-color>


  The case of Dick keeping a barking dog and Jane wanting to sleep in peace &

  quiet.

  They reach one bargain that both can agree to and the problem resolves on its

  own.

  The distribution of the initial right to the resources doesn't affect the

  fact that the problem reaches its optimum position once the bargain is allowed.


** Private solutions don't always work:

   because the cost of the bargain can outweight the benefit either party gets

   by owning the resources.


   While other times, the bargaining parties fail to act flexible enough to

   reach an agreement and it just breaks out like the labour strikes.


   In other cases, where the participating parties are numerous, coordinating the

   parties becomes difficult and sometimes impractical. In such times, the government

   can make a deal on behalf of private parties.



   So, to sum up the invisible hands as described by of Adam smith are powerful but

   not omnipotent.
