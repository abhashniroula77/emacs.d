* Broke the system outa nowhere today

  Someone suggested a way to clean the orphan packages and also some other

  things like pacman-uptimize(?) and I did that.

  Also changed the cursor theme. Also installed some chinese font.

  And when I rebooted, the login screen just wouldn't let me into the graphical

  interface and log me right out.


  Turned out one of xorg packages one was apparently deleted in orphan package

  sweep.


  After installing that, fluxbox started again. YAY!
