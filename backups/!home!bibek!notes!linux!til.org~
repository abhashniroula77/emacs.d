* Bash doesn't have something like "start quote" and "end quote".

  It just has interpretation mode. And quote act as a switch for that mode.

  If the interpretation mode is on(default), the text/command is interpreted.

  if there's a quote('), the interpretation mode is turned off and literal

  is assumed/passsed along to command.

  case in point.

  var=2

  echo '{print $'$var'}'  => {print $2}


* want the variable in bash to have a default value?

  Use the systex

  {variable:-defaultvalue} to asign the value

  eg.

  column={$1:-1}


* wanna clear the orphan packages?

  Here's what you wanna do.

  pacman -Qdt  --lists the orphan packages
  sudo pacman -Rs $(pacman -Qtdq) --deletes them!
